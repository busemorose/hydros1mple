  abstract = {AND CONCLUSIONS A method for estimating reference crop evapotranspiration, ETo from measured temperature alone is presented and compared with other methods of estimating ETo and with actual measured data. The estimated values of ETo from equation [4] presented herein compared favorably with those of other methods or lysimeter data, providing a better fit of the measured data in nearly all cases.},

  abstract = {This research sought to identify the most relevant approach to calculate potential evapotranspiration (PE) for use in a daily rainfall\textendash runoff model, while answering the following question: How can we use available atmospheric variables to represent the evaporative demand at the basin scale? The value of 27 PE models was assessed in terms of streamflow simulation efficiency over a large sample of 308 catchments located in France, Australia and the United States. While trying to identify which atmospheric variables were the most relevant to compute PE as input to rainfall\textendash runoff models, we showed that the formulae based on temperature and radiation tend to provide the best streamflow simulations. Surprisingly, PE approaches based on the Penman approach seem less advantageous to feed rainfall\textendash runoff models. This investigation has resulted in a proposal for a temperature-based PE model, combining simplicity and efficiency, and adapted to four rainfall\textendash runoff models. This PE model only requires mean air temperature (derived from long-term averages) and leads to a slight but steady improvement in rainfall\textendash runoff model efficiency.},

Extensive lysimetric data sets from two contrasting climatic regions were used to test the proposed version. The well-known gross underprediction of the original Thornthwaite approach for arid climates became a slight overprediction under the new version, but it was equivalent to that obtained with the well-recommended Penman\textendash Monteith FAO-56 (PM-56) parameterization scheme. The PM-56 schemes performed well for both environments.},

  abstract = {Potential evapotranspiration (ETp) and reference crop evapotranspiration (ETo) differ in their developments, concepts, equations and application fields, however, many researchers have mixed the utilization of the two terms. Thus, it is necessary to clarify the terms to guide their proper usage. The aim of this study is to provide a comprehensive review of the concepts, developments, equations and applications of ETp and ETo. The review shows clearly that the concepts and developments of ETp and ETo have long histories. The original concept of ETp was proposed by Thornthwaite, and that core idea with various improvements has been used up to now. The development of ETo, although initially confused with that of ETp, was formally defined as a standard method. The ETp equations were classified as mass-transfer-based, temperature-based, radiation-based and combination types. While the ETo equations were classified as being temperature-based, radiation-based, combination and pan-evaporation-based. Both terms are connected to evaporation and evapotranspiration, and although there have been ambiguities, ETp has been applied mostly in hydrology, meteorology and climatology, while ETo has been applied mostly in agronomy, agriculture, irrigation and ecology. ETp has been used to estimate drought indices, and ETo has been used in the single and dual crop coefficient methods and the Shuttleworth-Wallace method for estimating actual field evapotranspiration. This review serves to clarify the origins, definitions, and uses of ETp and ETo. It addresses common ambiguities between the terms in order to aid the proper utilization of the terms.},
